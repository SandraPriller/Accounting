# AccountingRestExample

A small accounting program that demonstrates the use of REST, REST service, and REST controllers.
Customers and products can be created, changed and deleted. Then an invoice is created and products added. 
Again, an invoice can be deleted or changed. For demonstration purposes, the open-source software POSTMAN was used.
